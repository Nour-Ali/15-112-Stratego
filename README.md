# 15-112-Stratego
15-112 Final Project
This repositry includes 3 files:
i) Insttuctions for playing the board game 'Stratego'
ii) 'ntali-GameLogic' - A completed fully-working text-based interface for the board game 'Stratego', that is played online using a CMUQ sever that requires a 
    username & password.
iii) 'ntali-GameBoard' - A working graphical user interface for the online implementation of Stratgeo that also uses the CMUQ server & requires a username 
    & password. To run this file, the library 'pygame' must be installed*, and the pictures uploaded in the repositry must also be saved 
    in the same folder as this code.
